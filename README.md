## How to debug

1. Install dependencies (in root dir and ./example dir)
2. Change "main" in `package.json` file from `lib/index.js` to `src/index.tsx`. (please do not push that as this is crucial in deployment!)
3. Open the `example` directory project in Android Studio, build and run the project. (`./example/android`)
4. Run `yarn start` in the `example` directory.
